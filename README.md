# Functions-and-Errors2
The Error Handing smart contract is a Solidity contract that demonstrates error handling using assert(), revert(), and require() statements. It showcases how these statements can add conditions and effectively handle errors in a Solidity contract.
# Purpose
The purpose of this smart contract is to showcase different error-handling techniques to ensure safe and reliable contract execution on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides three functions that illustrate the usage of assert(), revert(), and require() statements for handling different scenarios and providing appropriate feedback.
# Functions
# 'test'
This function takes an input num of type uint and uses the require() statement to check if the num is not equal to zero. If num is zero, the function will revert the transaction with the error message: "Number should not be zero." Otherwise, the function will execute successfully without any output.
# 'divide'
This function performs division with two input parameters: _numerator and _denominator, both of type uint. Before performing the division, the function uses the require() statement to check two conditions: _denominator should not be zero. If it is zero, the function will revert the transaction with the error message: "Denominator should not be zero." it should be always greater than the denominator. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with the error message: "Numerator must be greater than or equal to the denominator."
If both conditions are satisfied, the function will return the result of the division.
# 'mult'
This function takes an input a of type uint and uses the require() statement to check if a is greater than zero. If a is zero or negative, the function will revert the transaction with the error message: "Value of 'y' must be greater than zero." Otherwise, the function will return the result of multiplying a with a constant value x.

# Usage
To use this smart contract, you can deploy it on an Ethereum development environment, such as Remix or Truffle. Interact with the functions using appropriate inputs to observe the different error-handling mechanisms.
